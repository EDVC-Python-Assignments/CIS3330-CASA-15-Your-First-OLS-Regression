## CIS3330-CASA-15-Your-First-OLS-Regression-With-Python

## Instructions

In this CASA, you are asked to follow the OLS Regression tutorial created by Statology. To complete the assignment, complete the following:

1. Create your own data for Step 1. 
 * You can propose another set of pair observations (e.g., exercise-wellbeing, coding-jobs).
2. Perform an OLS regression and explain in your own words the result. Note, because you create another data set, your numbers cannot match the ones in the example.
3. Plot the line of best fit for your regression.

## Deliverables

1. Include all the code in the file `casa_15.py`
2. Create a report that explains your OLS similar to the one from Statology.
 * Include this report in the code repository but also submit it on Blackboard.
